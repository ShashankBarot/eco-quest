# 🌍 EcoQuest: Gamified AQI & CO₂ Monitoring
---

This project helps people track air quality (AQI) and CO₂ emissions in real time, forecast future trends, and take eco-friendly actions through gamified challenges.

🌍 **Key Features**

📊 Live AQI & CO₂ data fetching for a chosen city/region

🔮 Time-series forecasting for next-day air quality

⚠️ Smart alerts when pollution levels cross safe thresholds

🎮 Gamification layer with daily eco-missions (walk, plant a tree, use public transport)

🏆 Rewards, badges, and leaderboard to keep users motivated

💻 Frontend dashboard with real-time metrics & predictions

⚡ **Tech Stack**

Backend: FastAPI / Flask

Frontend: React / Next.js

Data & ML: APIs (OpenAQ, IQAir, etc.), Prophet / ARIMA for forecasting

Gamification: Custom missions, points, leaderboard

✨ **Why this project?**
Air pollution and CO₂ emissions affect health, climate, and daily life. While monitoring data is important, motivating people to act is even more crucial. Our solution not only informs users but also engages them through gamified eco-missions, turning awareness into action.
